### Create Next App

To start we will use `create-next-app` with the TypeScript flag to start a project using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), which I recommend. I advocate for TypeScript because I truly believe it helps make your project better, more secure and technically sound when you use typesafety. The CLI will also ask you about using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), another recommended option for improving your development process. ESLint helps to find and fix problems with JavaScript Code. But since we are using TypeScript, later we will also add [TypeScript - ESLint](https://typescript-eslint.io/), which allows ESLint to support TypeScript.

### Terminal

Once the dependencies are downloaded, you can open the project in your code editor of choice. For this guide I will be using [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Initial Project Structure

### Add TypeScript ESLint

Open a new terminal in your IDE and run the following command to add TypeScript ESLint and its dependencies to your project.

```sh
npm install --save-dev @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin
```

As soon as the dependencies are done installing, you should update the settings in the `.eslintrc.json` file that `create-next-app` created for you, to include the dependencies that were just added.

#### Default ESLint Configuration

#### Updated ESLint Configuration

Now we can test that our setup works by running the command `next lint` to lint our project with the new configuration.

### Success!

You have successfully added TypeScript ESLint to your Next.js application. You can find more recommended settings for your setup in the [Next.js Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/eslint). There you can find different options for your configuration that may be more suited to the specific needs of your application, such as using [linting custom directories/files](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/eslint#linting-custom-directories-and-files), [disabling rules](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/eslint#disabling-rules), or [using it with other tools](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/eslint#usage-with-other-tools).
