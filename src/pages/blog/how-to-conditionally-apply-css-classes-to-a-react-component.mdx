Consider we had to display information on some tickets in a ticket or issue tracker. The ticket structure might look something like this:

```js
const tickets = [
  {
    id: 1,
    subject: "windows not working",
    description: "I closed the window, but still nothing. Should I try closing the drapes?",
    status: "Closed"
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    subject: "slow download",
    description: "It takes 3 hours to download a 100mb file",
    status: "Open"
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    subject: "broken button",
    description: "Its not letting me press the sign in button.",
    status: "Open"
  },
]
```

Each of these tickets has a `property` called `status` which can either be "Open" or "Closed". We want the displayed tickets to change their values as well as their styling depending on the value of their `status` property. If the ticket is "Open" we want to style it with a red background. If the ticket is "Closed" we want to style it with a purple background.

We can accomplish this by using a `ternary` operator in JavaScript. Our `ternary` will check if the ticket is open or not and conditionally apply CSS classes.

In the example below, the component starts off with the class `badge`. We use JavaScript string interpolation - the dollar sign, and curly braces, wrapped by back-ticks `${}` - to include JavaScript in a string:

```js
<span
 className={`badge${ ticket.status === "Closed" ? " purple" : " red" }`}>
  {ticket.status}
</span>
```

The CSS classes above would be applied to match the following situations:

```js
// when the ticket is `Closed`
<span className="badge purple" >
  Closed
</span>

// when the ticket is `Open`
<span className="badge red" >
  Open
</span>
```

(notice the spaces are included, otherwise the string would be concatenated into one word)
If your component doesn't start off with any classes, you would just omit the class `badge` and remove the spaces before the classes that you want to conditionally apply:

```js
<span
 className={`${ ticket.status === "Closed" ? "purple" : "red" }`}>
  {ticket.status}
</span>
```

The CSS classes above would be applied to match the following situations:

```js
// when the ticket is `Closed`
<span className="purple" >
  Closed
</span>

// when the ticket is `Open`
<span className="red" >
  Open
</span>
```

### Conclusion

Try conditionally applying CSS classes to some of your React components in a project and let me know how it goes!
