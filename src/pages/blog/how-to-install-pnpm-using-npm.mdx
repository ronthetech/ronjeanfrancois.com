<a href="https://pnpm.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">pnpm</a> (Performant npm) was created with the <a href="https://pnpm.io/motivation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">purpose</a> of making it easier to download dependencies for your projects without having to worry about using up valuable disk space, while also making the installation faster. You have several options for installing pnpm on your machine.

### Installing pnpm using npm

npm i -g pnpm
```

### Installing pnpm using Homebrew

```

If you don't have <a href="https://scoop.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Scoop</a> installed, you can <a href="/blog/how-to-install-scoop-on-windows">read my post</a> to learn how to install it.

```
