Scoop makes a **shim** for each terminal application in the `~\scoop\shims` directory. These are like command-line shortcuts that can be accessed in your PATH. Scoop also makes a program shortcut in the 'Scoop Apps' Start menu folder for every graphical application that you install. This is an important distinction that helps you keep track of where your tools are located.

Try Scoop to install tools on your machine or download packages in your next application and let me know how it goes!
