## {frontmatter.description}

First you need to use the [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) to create a new application.

```sh
>ng new your-app
```

Use `npm` to install [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and its peer dependencies as `devDependencies`.

```sh
$ npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

You can use `npx` to generate a tailwindcss configuration file for your application.

```sh
$ npx tailwindcss init
```

Now you have to configure your template paths in the tailwind config file that was generated for you.

### `tailwind.config.js`

```js
// tailwind.config.js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    // add this line
    "./src/**/*.{html,ts}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

You have to add the `@tailwind` directives for the TailwindCSS layers to your CSS file.

### `./src/styles.css`

```css
/* ./src/styles.css' */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Lastly, you implement tailwindcss in your app with the `class` attribute.

### `app.component.html`

```html
<!-- app.component.html' -->
<h1 class="text-5xl font-bold uppercase">
  Angular is Awesome, and even better when you add TailwindCSS!
</h1>
```

After you start your build process you should be able to see the styles in your application.

```sh
ng serve
```

### Conclusion
